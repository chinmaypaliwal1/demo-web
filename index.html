    <h2>Every Child Has Right to Learn</h2>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        On any given school day, over 1 billion children around the world head
        to class.<br />

        <br />The world is facing a learning crisis. Millions of children and
        young people are not developing the skills they need to break out of
        poverty. The growth of technology and the increasingly broad range of
        actors providing online learning means we can deliver learning
        opportunities anywhere, at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lack of trained teachers, inadequate learning materials, makeshift
        classes and poor sanitation facilities make learning difficult for many
        children. Others come to school too hungry, sick or exhausted from work
        or household tasks to benefit from their lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The consequences are grave: An estimated 617 million children and
        adolescents around the world are unable to reach minimum proficiency
        levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in
        school.<br />
        <br />This learning crisis is the greatest global challenge to preparing
        children and adolescents for life, work and active citizenship

      <h4>
        The World Bank estimates a loss of US$10 trillion in earnings over the
        lifetime of this generation of children and young people if urgent
        action is not taken to address the learning crisis.<br />
        <br />
        We urgently need to reimagine education. A modern education should build
        and accredit basic skills – reading, writing and math – as well as
        skills in problem-solving, creativity, critical thinking that young
        people need for work, to start a business and to engage productively in
        their communities.<br />
        <br />
        availability and potential of technology means that digital learning
        should be part of a basic basket of essential services for every child
        and young person. This means connecting every child and young person –
        some 3.5 billion by 2030 – to world-class digital solutions that offer
        personalized learning to leapfrog to a brighter future.
